# Digital Business Card

This is a digital business card built with React and Vite. It dynamically fetches personal information from a `data.json` file, making it easy to customize.

## Overview

This digital business card showcases:

* **Personal Information:** Displays your name and professional title.
* **Profile Picture:** Features your profile image.
* **About Section:** Provides a brief description about you.
* **Action Buttons:** Includes buttons for your developer portfolio and personal training website.
* **Direct Email Link:** Offers a button to easily send you an email with a pre-filled subject and body.
* **Social Media Links:** Links to your Instagram, TikTok, GitHub, and LinkedIn profiles.
* **Easy Customization:** All personal details are loaded from a `public/data.json` file, allowing for simple modification without touching the React code.

## Technologies Used

* **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Vite:** A build tool that provides a fast and efficient development experience.
* **TypeScript:** Adds static typing to JavaScript for improved code maintainability.
* **Font Awesome:** For social media icons.
* **CSS:** For styling (styles are located in `src/app.css`).

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Customize your information:**
    * Open the `public/data.json` file.
    * Modify the values for `name`, `title`, `about`, `developerPortfolioUrl`, `personalTrainingUrl`, `email`, `emailSubject`, `emailBody`, `emailButtonText`, `developerPortfolioButtonText`, and `personalTrainingButtonText` with your own details.
    * Replace `src/assets/Profilepicture.jpg` with your own profile picture.

4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```

    This will start the Vite development server, and you can view your digital business card in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:5173`).

## Building for Production

To build a production-ready version of your digital business card:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build

This will create a dist folder containing the optimized build of your application, which you can then deploy to a web hosting service.

Customization
Styling: You can customize the appearance of the digital business card by editing the src/app.css file.
Adding Features: Feel free to add more components or modify the existing ones in the src/components directory to include additional information or functionality. Remember to update the data.json file and the About.tsx component accordingly if you add new data fields.
Deployment
The dist folder generated by the build command contains the static files you need to deploy your digital business card. You can use various hosting platforms like Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or others to host these files.
